First Project: It's my first time using CSS and HTML together. I built this a couple of hours after I learned how to use CSS and used it as an external file for my biography. Making it wasn't hard or complicated. It was fun to make and I enjoyed those couple of hours figuring out how CSS and HTML worked.

The site turned out great, I made my own background image and found all of the elements online to make it exactly how I wanted it.

It was a great opportunity for me to learn frontend coding and use markup languages such as CSS and HTML.
